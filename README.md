*Abstract*

Nucleic acids in wastewater are a valuable source of data for microbial surveillance. In this study, we have longitudinally collected RNA samples from a wastewater treatment plant in Berlin/Germany from March 2021 to July 2022, as well as 24 DNA samples from May to July 2022. Our analysis tracked the abundance and genetic variations of human astroviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses, and adenoviruses, highlighting the detailed observation of human pathogens made possible using wastewater. We also utilized a broad enrichment panel to detect waves of respiratory pathogens, such as RSV, influenza, and common cold coronaviruses, with high agreement with clinical data. Moreover, a profile Hidden Markov Model-based search enabled us to identify over 100 thousand novel sequence assemblies likely not belonging to known virus species, providing a significant expansion of our knowledge of virus diversity. We also performed phylogenetic analysis for bunyaviruses and parvoviruses, providing insight into their evolutionary relationships. Finally, we identified hundreds of novel protein sequences for CRISPR-associated proteins, including Transposase B, a class of small RNA-guided DNA editing enzymes. Our results demonstrate the value of wastewater-derived genomic sequencing data for microbial surveillance as well as discovery of novel viruses and enzymes, with potential applications in public health, planetary virome research, and biotechnology.
